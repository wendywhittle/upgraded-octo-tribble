"""Competing perspectives on a deal.

Implements Charter §3 (the Computational Kaleidoscope) as four deterministic,
documented analytical lenses: Bull, Bear (contrarian), Quant, and Skeptic.

These are NOT autonomous agents and they do not simulate AI disagreement.
Each lens is a fixed, auditable methodology: a pure function of the deal's
own inputs, derived metrics, missing data, and evidence log. The methodology
for each lens is stated in its docstring so any output can be traced back to
the rule that produced it.

Dissent is preserved structurally (Charter §2.1, §10): each lens is stored
as a separate record and lenses are never merged, averaged, or synthesized
into a single view. Disagreement stays visible.
